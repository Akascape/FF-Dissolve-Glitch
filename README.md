# FF Dissolve Glitch
This is a free GUI based glitch tool that uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to create awesome and wierd motion interpolated glitches in videos. I call it FF dissolve glitch because it creates kinda dissolving pixel type effect. I made this for those who don't like to use command line everytime and yes, its free and open source python project!

## How to Install?
- Install these requirements using pip:
  - [customtkinter](https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/)
  - [tkdial](https://pypi.org/project/tkdial/)
  - [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- Download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) properly and set its path to environment.
- Then, simply run `ff-dissolve-glitch.py`
## How to use?
- Click the OPEN button and choose your video file **(short videos are recommended)**
- Choose the desired modes and parameters
- Then simply click the **export** button and wait for the video to get baked. **(Conversions will be very slow)**
- After baking, you can view the video and see the results.
<br>Note: Press 'q' in the command shell if you want to safely end any ffmpeg process.
<br>You can try experimenting with all the modes but some modes **may not give any result)**

More information about motion interpolation modes are given here- [ffmpeg-filters: interpolate](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#minterpolate)

### More Info
This project is possible because of Antonio Roberts's guide on [motion-interpolation-glitch-using-ffmpeg](https://www.hellocatfood.com/motion-interpolation-for-glitch-aesthetics-using-ffmpeg-part-0/), so a big thanks to Antonio. You can see his full guide where he described all the combinations of modes with video examples.
