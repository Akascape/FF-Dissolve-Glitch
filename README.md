# FF Dissolve Glitch
This is a free GUI based glitch tool that uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to create awesome and wierd motion interpolated glitches in videos. I call it FF dissolve glitch because it creates kinda dissolving pixel type effect. I made this for those who don't like to use command line everytime and yes, its free and open source python script!

## How to Install?
- simply run "FF dissolve glitch.py" and please make sure you have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed or else it will not work.
## How to use?
- Click the OPEN button and choose your video file (short videos are recommended)
- Then choose the desired modes and parameters
- Then simply click the GLITCH button and wait for the video to get baked
- After baking, you can view the video which will be saved in the same directory
<br>Note: Press q in the command shell if you want to safely end the ffmpeg process.
<br>You can try experimenting with all the modes and see the results!

### More Info
This project is possible because of Antonio Roberts's guide on [motion-interpolation-glitch-using-ffmpeg](https://www.hellocatfood.com/motion-interpolation-for-glitch-aesthetics-using-ffmpeg-part-0/), so a big thanks to Antonio. You can see his full guide where he described all the combinations of modes with video examples.
